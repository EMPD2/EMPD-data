Accessing the data
------------------
The latest version of this data can be downloaded and accessed through the interactive viewer at EMPD2.github.io_ (see `EMPD2.github.io/data`_ for more information on this). The data is then the same as in the raw format mentioned below.

Otherwise you can access the EMPD data through this repository.

.. contents:: We provide the following formats
    :local:

Raw tab-delimited format: meta.tsv_
***********************************
- The meta data is stored as tab-delimited format in the `meta.tsv`_ file. See the `Column names <column-names>`_ below for further information
- The sample data is stored in the `samples`_ directory, one tab-delimited
  file per row in `meta.tsv`_. The filename is determined by the corresponding
  *SampleName* in the meta data.
  
  
Postgres dump: EMPD2.sql_
*************************
We provide a relational postgres dump for the EMPD2 in the `postgres/EMPD2.sql`__ file. If you are familiar with Postgres and have a postgres server running on your machine, you can import this data via::

  createdb EMPD2
  psql EMPD2 -f EMPD2.sql
  
Note that you can directly pipe from the raw github file into the database via curl::

  createdb EMPD2
  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EMPD2/EMPD-data/master/postgres/EMPD2.sql | psql EMPD2
  
or, if you want to use a specific version, e.g. ``v1.0``, use::

  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EMPD2/EMPD-data/v1.0/postgres/EMPD2.sql | psql EMPD2
  

Tab-delimited database: tab-delimited_
**************************************
A tab-delimited version of the postgres dump is also available in the tab-delimited_ folder.

okexcept
    Comma-delimited combination of the above fields. The EMPD tests failed on these columns for the given sample. Possible values in here are

    Country
        The Country of the *Latitude* and *Longitude* does not match with the NaturalEarth data (probably because it is close to a border)

        The longitudinal information is invalid
    Temperature
        No temperature has been extracted for the given sample
    Precipitation
        No precipitation has been extracted for the given sample
    Elevation
        The sample has no elevation data
