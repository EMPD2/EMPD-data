Fletcher_b23	ALI 7	Lake Sidi Ali	Morocco	-5.0013342	33.065751	2087	A				The site lies within the montane-Mediterranean bioclimate, and the dominant arboreal taxa at the site are Cedrus atlantica, Quercus rotundifolia and Juniperus thurifera. The forest cover around Sidi Ali is degraded by commercial logging, cutting for firewood and grazing pressure. The cedar population at Sidi Ali, which includes individuals of > 900 years in age (Copes-Gerbitz, unpublished dendrochronological data), shows signs of extensive senescence and dieback. Restoration efforts including planting of seedlings are underway, but there does not yet appear to be widespread establishment of young trees in the area. The surrounding vegetation is a mix of scrub and forest (Morgan 1982; Lecompte 1986). A wide range of woody taxa can be observed around Sidi Ali, including Ribes uva-crispa L., Rosa spp. and Berberis hispanica along the rocky lake margins, spiny cushion-form shrubs in open areas including Erinacea anthyllis, and a range of mesic tree taxa in the best preserved forest fragments on the north-facing slopes of the lake’s southern margin. These latter include Acer monspessulanum L., Crataegus lacciniata Steven ex Besser and Fraxinus dimorpha Coss. et Dureiu. The lake is a popular tourist spot and the area is subject to extensive animal grazing.

Berberis hispanica Boiss. et Reut. and Prunus prostrata Labill. develop in rocky crevices and gullies. There is considerable grazing pressure from sheep and goats. There is little to no tree cover in the immediate area, excluding occasional junipers (Juniperus thurifera) near the lake itself, and a few trees (Pinus halepensis Mill. and Populus sp.) around the western margin of the lake. Tree cover with J. thurifera and Quercus rotundifolia is developed at around 20 km distance across the watershed to the northwest on Atlantic (northwest) facing slopes, and Cedrus forest is located around 40 km distance to the northeast on the slopes of Jbel Masker.

The forest cover around Sidi Ali is degraded by commercial logging, cutting for firewood and grazing pressure. The cedar population at Sidi Ali, which includes individuals of > 900 years in age (Copes-Gerbitz, unpublished dendrochronological data), shows signs of extensive senescence and dieback. Restoration efforts including planting of seedlings are underway, but there does not yet appear to be widespread establishment of young trees in the area. The surrounding vegetation is a mix of scrub and forest (Morgan 1982; Lecompte 1986). A wide range of woody taxa can be observed around Sidi Ali, including Ribes uva-crispa L., Rosa spp. and Berberis hispanica along the rocky lake margins, spiny cushion-form shrubs in open areas including Erinacea anthyllis, and a range of mesic tree taxa in the best preserved forest fragments on the north-facing slopes of the lake’s southern margin. These latter include Acer monspessulanum L., Crataegus lacciniata Steven ex Besser and Fraxinus dimorpha Coss. et Dureiu.

Fletcher_b29	ALI 13	Lake Sidi Ali	Morocco	-4.9932661	33.067504	2191	A				The site lies within the montane-Mediterranean bioclimate, and the dominant arboreal taxa at the site are Cedrus atlantica, Quercus rotundifolia and Juniperus thurifera. The forest cover around Sidi Ali is degraded by commercial logging, cutting for firewood and grazing pressure. The cedar population at Sidi Ali, which includes individuals of > 900 years in age (Copes-Gerbitz, unpublished dendrochronological data), shows signs of extensive senescence and dieback. Restoration efforts including planting of seedlings are underway, but there does not yet appear to be widespread establishment of young trees in the area. The surrounding vegetation is a mix of scrub and forest (Morgan 1982; Lecompte 1986). A wide range of woody taxa can be observed around Sidi Ali, including Ribes uva-crispa L., Rosa spp. and Berberis hispanica along the rocky lake margins, spiny cushion-form shrubs in open areas including Erinacea anthyllis, and a range of mesic tree taxa in the best preserved forest fragments on the north-facing slopes of the lake’s southern margin. These latter include Acer monspessulanum L., Crataegus lacciniata Steven ex Besser and Fraxinus dimorpha Coss. et Dureiu. The lake is a popular tourist spot and the area is subject to extensive animal grazing.
